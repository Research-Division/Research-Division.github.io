\section{Trade Overview Narrative (generateTradeNarrative)}

\subsection{Example Output}
\begin{quote}
\textit{As of 2024, \textbf{China} ranked 3\textsuperscript{rd} among all \textbf{U.S.} trading partners by total goods trade — up from 6\textsuperscript{th}. It is currently the 1\textsuperscript{st} largest source of imports and the 3\textsuperscript{rd} largest destination for exports.}

\textit{While the \textbf{U.S.} currently runs a trade deficit with \textbf{China}, this has not always been the case. Over the past 32 years, the \textbf{U.S.} has run a deficit in 78\% of years. This trend has strengthened in recent years, with the \textbf{U.S.} running a deficit in 4 out of 5 years over the past 5 years.}

\textit{\textbf{China} accounts for 16.2\% of total \textbf{U.S.} imports (\$427.2B) and 8.7\% of \textbf{U.S.} exports (\$147.8B), resulting in a deficit of \$279.4B.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Basic Trade Ranking (Always Shown)}
As of \var{latestYear}, \bold{\var{countryName}} ranked \var{tradeRank\_latest} among all \bold{U.S.} trading partners by total goods trade — \var{tradeDirection}. It is currently the \var{importRank\_latest} largest source of imports and the \var{exportRank\_latest} largest destination for exports.

\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Trade Balance Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Consistent Deficit}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{alwaysType === "deficit"}

The \bold{U.S.} has consistently run a trade deficit with \bold{\var{countryName}} since 1992.

\subsubsection{Consistent Surplus}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{alwaysType === "surplus"}

The \bold{U.S.} has consistently maintained a trade surplus with \bold{\var{countryName}} since 1992.

\subsubsection{Complex Alternating Pattern}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{alwaysType is neither "deficit" nor "surplus"}

While the \bold{U.S.} currently runs a trade \var{currentStatusText} with \bold{\var{countryName}}, this has not always been the case. Over the past \var{totalYearsAnalyzed} years, the \bold{U.S.} has run a \var{currentStatusText} in \var{currentPercentage}\% of years.

\paragraph{Pattern Stability Logic:}
The pattern stability is determined by comparing historical rates vs. recent 5-year rates using \cond{rateDifference = |recentRate - historicalRate|}:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textit{Stable pattern:} \cond{rateDifference < 0.2 AND recent5yrPct is between 1-99\%}\\
``This pattern has not changed substantially in recent years, with the \bold{U.S.} running a \var{currentStatusText} in \var{recent5yrYears} out of \var{yearsAnalyzed5yr} years over the past 5 years.''

\item \textit{Intensified pattern:} \cond{recentRate > historicalRate AND recent5yrPct === 100\%}\\
``This trend has intensified in recent years, with the \bold{U.S.} running a \var{currentStatusText} in every year over the past 5 years.''

\item \textit{Strengthened pattern:} \cond{recentRate > historicalRate AND recent5yrPct < 100\%}\\
``This trend has strengthened in recent years, with the \bold{U.S.} running a \var{currentStatusText} in \var{recent5yrYears} out of \var{yearsAnalyzed5yr} years over the past 5 years.''

\item \textit{Weakened pattern:} \cond{recentRate < historicalRate AND recent5yrPct > 0\%}\\
``However, this pattern has weakened in recent years, with the \bold{U.S.} running a \var{currentStatusText} in only \var{recent5yrYears} out of \var{yearsAnalyzed5yr} years over the past 5 years.''

\item \textit{Reversed pattern:} \cond{recentRate < historicalRate AND recent5yrPct === 0\%}\\
``However, this pattern has reversed in recent years, with the \bold{U.S.} running no \var{currentStatusText} in the past 5 years.''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trade Values Summary}
\bold{\var{countryName}} accounts for \var{importShare}\% of total \bold{U.S.} imports (\var{importValue}) and \var{exportShare}\% of \bold{U.S.} exports (\var{exportValue}), resulting in a \var{deficitOrSurplus} of \var{bilateralDeficit}.

\section{Product Trade Narrative (generateProductNarrative)}

\subsection{Example Output}
\begin{quote}
\textit{The \textbf{U.S.} maintains a diverse trade relationship, spanning 47 HS-4 import categories (65th percentile) and 89 HS-4 export categories (72nd percentile) with \textbf{Germany}.}

\textit{The sectoral composition of \textbf{U.S.} imports from \textbf{Germany} is moderately concentrated: 22.4\% in Machinery and Mechanical Appliances (\$28.7B), 18.1\% in Vehicles Other Than Railway (\$23.2B), and 12.3\% in Pharmaceutical Products (\$15.8B), with remaining sectors each below 15\%.}

\paragraph{Asymmetry Note Logic:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textit{No note:} \cond{|importPct - exportPct| < 25\%}
\item \textit{Import-heavy:} \cond{importPct > exportPct + 25\%}\\
``, with notably broader import diversity than export concentration''
\item \textit{Export-heavy:} \cond{exportPct > importPct + 25\%}\\
``, with the \bold{U.S.} exporting across more categories than it imports''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sectoral Composition (Always Shown)}
\var{transition} sectoral composition of \bold{U.S.} imports from \bold{\var{countryName}} is \var{concentration}: \var{topSectorShare} in \var{topSectorTitle} (\var{topSectorValue}), \var{secondSectorShare} in \var{secondSectorTitle} (\var{secondSectorValue}), and \var{thirdSectorShare} in \var{thirdSectorTitle} (\var{thirdSectorValue}), with remaining sectors each below 15\%.

\paragraph{Concentration Classification:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textit{highly concentrated:} \cond{topShare >= 60\%}
\item \textit{moderately concentrated:} \cond{topShare >= 40\%}
\item \textit{broadly distributed:} \cond{topShare < 40\%}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Transition Word Logic:}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textit{``However, the'':} \cond{(scope is "exceptionally broad" OR "diverse") AND concentration !== "broadly distributed"}
\item \textit{``The'':} \cond{All other cases}
\end{itemize}

\item \textit{No additional note:} \cond{majors.length <= 5}
\item \textit{With note:} \cond{majors.length > 5}\\
``among \var{totalCount} total categories where \bold{\var{countryName}} provides \var{threshold}\% or more of \bold{U.S.} imports''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Export Strengths}

\textbf{Decision Logic:} Filter products where \cond{marketShare >= threshold} (typically 10\%)

\subsubsection{No Primary Destination}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{majors.length === 0}

\bold{\var{countryName}} is not a primary destination for \bold{U.S.} exports in any HS-4 product categories (no products where \bold{\var{countryName}} receives \var{threshold}\% or more of total \bold{U.S.} exports).

\section{Time Series Narrative (generateTimeSeriesNarrative)}

\subsection{Example Output}
\begin{quote}
\textit{Over the past three decades (1994--2024), U.S.--Mexico trade has evolved significantly. Import patterns have shown moderate changes, while export composition has remained remarkably stable.}

\textit{\textbf{Mexico} serves as a major supplier to the \textbf{U.S.} across several key sectors, including Vehicles Other Than Railway, Machinery and Mechanical Appliances, Electrical Machinery and Equipment, and Mineral Fuels. Conversely, \textbf{Mexico} represents an important destination for U.S. exports, particularly in Machinery and Mechanical Appliances and Electrical Machinery and Equipment.}

\textit{From 1994 to 2024, imports from \textbf{Mexico} have seen notable growth in Vehicles Other Than Railway, which climbed from 8\textsuperscript{th} to 2\textsuperscript{nd} place, and Electrical Machinery and Equipment, which climbed from 12\textsuperscript{th} to 4\textsuperscript{th} place. Over the same period, some sectors have lost ground, including Textiles and Textile Articles, which fell from 3\textsuperscript{rd} to 15\textsuperscript{th} place. These changes represent shifts in \textbf{Mexico's} competitive position among supplier countries to the \textbf{U.S.} market.}

\textit{\textbf{Figures 1, 2,} and \textbf{3} respectively display the trade balance, value of imports, and value of exports between the \textbf{U.S.} and \textbf{Mexico}. The commodity groups displayed are grouped into four broader categories (select the dropdown to change categories).}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Overview (Always Shown)}
Over the past three decades (1994--2024), U.S.--\var{countryName} trade has evolved significantly. Import patterns have \var{importChange}, while export composition has \var{exportChange}.

\paragraph{Change Classification Logic:}
Compare top 3 sectors between 1994 and 2024:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textit{remained remarkably stable:} \cond{overlap.length === 3}
\item \textit{shown moderate changes:} \cond{overlap.length >= 2}  
\item \textit{undergone substantial transformation:} \cond{overlap.length === 1}
\item \textit{been completely restructured:} \cond{overlap.length === 0}
\end{itemize}
Where \cond{overlap = oldTitles.filter(t => newTitles.includes(t))}

\subsection{International Significance}

\textbf{Decision Logic:} Based on availability of \cond{majorExports} and \cond{majorDestinations} arrays

\subsubsection{Both Supplier and Destination}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{majorExports.length > 0 AND majorDestinations.length > 0}

\bold{\var{countryName}} serves as a major supplier to the \bold{U.S.} across several key sectors, including \var{majorExportsList}. Conversely, \bold{\var{countryName}} represents an important destination for U.S. exports, particularly in \var{majorDestinationsList}.

\subsubsection{Major Supplier Only}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{majorExports.length > 0 AND majorDestinations.length === 0}

\bold{\var{countryName}} serves as a major supplier to the \bold{U.S.} across several key sectors, including \var{majorExportsList}.

\subsubsection{Major Destination Only}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{majorExports.length === 0 AND majorDestinations.length > 0}

\bold{\var{countryName}} represents an important destination for \bold{U.S.} exports, particularly in \var{majorDestinationsList}.

\subsubsection{No Major Role}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{majorExports.length === 0 AND majorDestinations.length === 0}

\bold{\var{countryName}} does not rank among the top trading partners for the \bold{U.S.} in any specific HS category.

\subsection{Import Changes}

\textbf{Filtering Logic:} 
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
significantChanges = changes.filter(change => {
  rankDelta = |change.rank_change|;
  valueDelta = |parseFloat(change.value_change_pct)|;
  return rankDelta >= 3 OR valueDelta >= 50;
})
\end{Verbatim}

\textbf{Sorting Priority:} 1) Larger rank changes, 2) Larger value changes

\subsubsection{Both Growth and Decline}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{impG.length > 0 AND impS.length > 0}

From 1994 to 2024, imports from \bold{\var{countryName}} have seen notable growth in \var{growingImportsList}. Over the same period, some sectors have lost ground, including \var{shrinkingImportsList}. These changes represent shifts in \bold{\var{countryName}'s} competitive position among supplier countries to the \bold{U.S.} market.

\subsubsection{Growth Only}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{impG.length > 0 AND impS.length === 0}

Since 1994, imports from \bold{\var{countryName}} have shown notable growth, particularly in \var{growingImportsList}. These gains represent improvements in \bold{\var{countryName}'s} competitive position among supplier countries to the \bold{U.S.} market.

\subsubsection{Decline Only}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{impG.length === 0 AND impS.length > 0}

Over the past three decades, some import sectors from \bold{\var{countryName}} have lost ground, including \var{shrinkingImportsList}. These declines represent weakening in \bold{\var{countryName}'s} competitive position among supplier countries to the \bold{U.S.} market.

\subsubsection{No Significant Changes}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{impG.length === 0 AND impS.length === 0}

No significant import ranking changes detected for \bold{\var{countryName}} over the analyzed period.

\subsection{Export Changes}

\textbf{Same Filtering \& Sorting Logic as Import Changes}

\subsubsection{Both Growth and Decline}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{expG.length > 0 AND expS.length > 0}

For \bold{U.S.} exports to \bold{\var{countryName}}, the 30-year trend shows several sectors gaining prominence, such as \var{growingExportsList}, though certain categories have seen their significance diminish, including \var{shrinkingExportsList}. This reflects \bold{\var{countryName}'s} evolving importance as a destination market for \bold{U.S.} goods across different sectors.

\subsubsection{Growth Only}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{expG.length > 0 AND expS.length === 0}

\bold{U.S.} export trends to \bold{\var{countryName}} since 1994 show several sectors gaining prominence, such as \var{growingExportsList}. This reflects \bold{\var{countryName}'s} growing importance as a destination market for \bold{U.S.} goods in these sectors.

\subsubsection{Decline Only}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{expG.length === 0 AND expS.length > 0}

Over the past three decades, certain \bold{U.S.} export categories to \bold{\var{countryName}} have seen their significance diminish, notably \var{shrinkingExportsList}. This reflects \bold{\var{countryName}'s} declining importance as a destination market for \bold{U.S.} goods in these sectors.

\subsubsection{No Significant Changes}
\textbf{Condition:} \cond{expG.length === 0 AND expS.length === 0}

No significant export ranking changes detected for \bold{\var{countryName}} over the analyzed period.
